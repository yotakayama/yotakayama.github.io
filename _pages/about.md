I'm a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in control system engineering at the [Laboratory of Signals and Systems (L2S)](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr), [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en/), [University of Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/) in France, where I’m fortunate to be funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).

I completed my master's degree at the Graduate School of Informatics, [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en), where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Toshiyuki Ohtsuka](http://www.ids.sys.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ohtsuka/index.htm), and my bachelor's degree at the School of Informatics and Mathematical Science, Faculty of Engineering, also at Kyoto University.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
</div>
---------------------------------------
I'm passionate about developing safe and reliable AI for real-world systems, with a focus on bridging **machine learning** and **formal methods** for cyber-physical systems. My current interests include:

- **Optimization Algorithms:** Designing efficient optimization techniques for decision-making under uncertainty.  
- **Cyber-Physical Systems:** Applying formal verification and control theory to guarantee safety and performance in complex systems.
- **Safe Learning and Control:** Enhancing reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) with formal safety guarantees.    
- **Applications to Power Systems:** Modeling and controlling power networks with robustness against disturbances and uncertainties.  

Recently, I've started exploring the **theoretical foundations of fine-tuning RL algorithms** for foundational models, aiming to improve their adaptability and generalization capabilities.

 * Safe Learning Frameworks: Developing innovative stochastic frameworks to ensure ethical and reliable LLM performance. 

* Formal Verification for AI: Applying methods from control theory, symbolic reasoning, and Bayesian approaches to probabilistically guarantee the behavior of LLMs

* Optimization Algorithms: Designing efficient algorithms for formal specifications and temporal reasoning. My STLCCP algorithm has improved processing speed for temporal logic constraints.

* Key Research Areas:
a) Control theory and reinforcement learning
b) Formal verification and symbolic methods
c) Stochastic programming and Bayesian approaches

* Hallucination Mitigation: Advancing techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to reduce LLM hallucinations.
 Hallucination Mitigation: I focus on tackling LLM hallucinations, particularly in the temporal reasoning domain. The Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework is one approach I'm exploring to address this challenge.
Probabilistic Guarantees: I investigate how we can provide probabilistic guarantees against hallucinations in LLMs and potential Artificial General Intelligence systems.
Interdisciplinary Approach:

 __Control and verification of Cyber Physical Systems__: are generally tough, due to the hybrid nature of CPS, in which both continuous and discrete dynamics exist. 
 Such hybrid systems are becoming very complex, and so the specification requirements are.
 the mathematical approaches developed in the field of 
My research focuses on control of cyber physical system (CPS), using the method of __optimization, control theory, formal methods and machine learning__. 


I use tools from the field of control theory, such as optimal control, Lyapunov's method, stability, and nonlinear control mainly to deal with continuous dynamics.

I use tools from the field of formal method, such as temporal logic, automata theory, category theory, and other abstract algebraic methods mainly to specify requirements and to deal with discrete dynamics.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
