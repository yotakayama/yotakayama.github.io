### *Research Interests*
---------------------------------------
My research passion lie at the intersection of safe learning, formal verification, and cyber-physical systems. Recently, I've begun to explore their applications in addressing hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of temporal reasoning. Several keywords include:

* **Safe learning and control**
* **Optimization algortihm**
* **cyber-physical systems and Formal methods** 

 <style>/*

 * Safe Learning Frameworks: Developing innovative stochastic frameworks to ensure ethical and reliable LLM performance. 

* Formal Verification for AI: Applying methods from control theory, symbolic reasoning, and Bayesian approaches to probabilistically guarantee the behavior of LLMs

* Optimization Algorithms: Designing efficient algorithms for formal specifications and temporal reasoning. My STLCCP algorithm has improved processing speed for temporal logic constraints.

* Key Research Areas:
a) Control theory and reinforcement learning
b) Formal verification and symbolic methods
c) Stochastic programming and Bayesian approaches

* Hallucination Mitigation: Advancing techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to reduce LLM hallucinations.
 Hallucination Mitigation: I focus on tackling LLM hallucinations, particularly in the temporal reasoning domain. The Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework is one approach I'm exploring to address this challenge.
Probabilistic Guarantees: I investigate how we can provide probabilistic guarantees against hallucinations in LLMs and potential Artificial General Intelligence systems.
Interdisciplinary Approach:

 __Control and verification of Cyber Physical Systems__: are generally tough, due to the hybrid nature of CPS, in which both continuous and discrete dynamics exist. 
 Such hybrid systems are becoming very complex, and so the specification requirements are.
 the mathematical approaches developed in the field of 
My research focuses on control of cyber physical system (CPS), using the method of __optimization, control theory, formal methods and machine learning__. 


I use tools from the field of control theory, such as optimal control, Lyapunov's method, stability, and nonlinear control mainly to deal with continuous dynamics.

I use tools from the field of formal method, such as temporal logic, automata theory, category theory, and other abstract algebraic methods mainly to specify requirements and to deal with discrete dynamics.
