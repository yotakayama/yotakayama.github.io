Hi, I am Yoshinari Takayama, a PhD student at the [Laboratoire des Signaux et Systèmes (L2S)](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr), a joint research unit of [Centrale Supélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en/),[Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/) and [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en/). My research focuses on the control and verification of cyber-physical systems using symbolic methods, with a particular emphasis on power systems applications. The thesis is funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).

Between 2021 and 2023, I completed my master's degree at the Graduate School of Informatics, [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en), under the supervison of [Toshiyuki Ohtsuka](http://www.ids.sys.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ohtsuka/index.htm). Between 2017 and 2021, I completed my bachelor's degree at the School of Informatics and Mathematical Science, Faculty of Engineering, [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en).

### *Research Interests*
---------------------------------------
 * Hybrid Dynamical System
 * Control Theory
 * Symbolic Methods


<!--The problems of __control and verification of Hybrid Dynamical Systems__ are generally tough to deal with, due to the hybrid nature of CPS, in which both continuous and discrete dynamics exist. 
 Such hybrid systems are becoming very complex, and so the specification requirements are.
 the mathematical approaches developed in the field of 
My research focuses on analysis and control of cyber physical system (CPS), using the method of __optimization, control theory, formal methods and machine learning__. --> 

 <style>/*
I use tools from the field of control theory, such as optimal control, Lyapunov's method, stability, and nonlinear control mainly to deal with continuous dynamics.

I use tools from the field of formal method, such as temporal logic, automata theory, category theory, and other abstract algebraic methods mainly to specify requirements and to deal with discrete dynamics.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.

Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I learned Nonlinear Control, Model Predictive Control, Optimization (systems and control) in Ohtsuka lab, and I am learning Formal Methods and automata theory in Hasuo lab, 
both of which are needed to tackle the problems of control  and verification of Cyber-Physical System, the core of my research interests.
